I developed a Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the main focus on JavaScript logic.
The game allows users to select between rock, paper, or scissors, and plays against a computer-generated choice.
JavaScript handles the game logic, score tracking, and dynamically updates the result on the screen.
Event listeners capture user input and trigger the outcome evaluation function.
The UI provides instant feedback with text and color changes to indicate win, lose, or draw.
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, conditionals, and event handling in JavaScript.
